Esmuflily
=========

Esmuflily is an extension for [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/) that supports
[SMuFL](http://www.smufl.org/ "Standard Music Font Layout") compliant fonts
like [Bravura](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/bravura)
or [Ekmelos](https://github.com/tr-igem/ekmelos).

It provides switches to turn on the SMuFL support for individual types
of graphical objects (clefs, note heads, flags, etc.) and it defines
additional commands and styles for SMuFL glyphs not available in LilyPond.
So scores can benefit from both SMuFL's comprehensive character set
and LilyPond's awesome Emmentaler font.
Accidentals and key signatures are omitted. They are supported in detail
by [Ekmelily](https://github.com/tr-igem/ekmelily).

Esmuflily requires LilyPond version 2.24 or higher.
