Esmuflily
=========

Esmuflily is an extension for [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/) that supports
[SMuFL](http://www.smufl.org/ "Standard Music Font Layout") compliant fonts.

It provides switches for the SMuFL support
and additional commands and styles for SMuFL glyphs not available in LilyPond.
So scores can benefit from both, SMuFL's comprehensive character set
and LilyPond's awesome Emmentaler font.

Accidentals and key signatures are omitted. They are supported in detail
by [Ekmelily](https://github.com/tr-igem/ekmelily).

Esmuflily requires LilyPond version 2.24 or higher.
